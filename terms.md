## Build Time

Build time is like the "preparation phase" before your website goes live. It's when all the code you've written gets transformed into a version that can be efficiently delivered to users' browsers. This might involve tasks like turning your modern JavaScript code into a version that older browsers can understand, or turning your React components into HTML files.

In Next.js, build time is when your web pages are pre-made. Instead of making each page as users ask for it, you make all the pages beforehand. This makes your website faster.

Think of it like cooking all the food before your guests arrive. You do all the hard work once, and then when your guests (the users) arrive, they can enjoy the food (your website) quickly and easily.
